## Project Description
### Motivation

This project addresses the need for advanced modeling techniques in dentistry, allowing for the reconstruction and generation of detailed 3D tooth models. By employing a VAE, the project leverages the power of machine learning to enhance dental applications, improving diagnostics, treatment planning, and overall patient care.

**Possible Applications**
1. **Automated Diagnosis**: A VAE can analyze 3D dental scans to identify abnormalities or conditions such as cavities, misalignment, or periodontal disease. By learning from a variety of healthy and unhealthy tooth structures, it can assist dentists in making accurate diagnoses.
2. **Custom Prosthetics and Implants**: The model can generate highly personalized dental implants and prosthetics based on a patient's unique dental morphology. This results in improved fit and functionality, enhancing the overall patient experience.
3. **Predictive Analytics for Treatment Outcomes**: Utilizing historical treatment data, a VAE can help predict the outcomes of various dental procedures. This assists dental professionals in choosing the most effective treatment options for their patients.

*While this project focuses on 3D data of teeth, it can be adapted for various applications involving 3D data in other fields.*

### Content
This project includes the following key components:

1. **Synthetic Tooth Model Creation:** Generate synthetic tooth models that serve as placeholders for real 3D data, providing a foundation for training and evaluation of the model.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Implement preprocessing techniques to convert 3D models into point clouds, ensuring they are suitable for deep learning applications.

3. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Design:** Develop a VAE that learns the statistical distribution of the 3D data, enabling effective reconstruction and generation of new tooth models.

4. **Model Application:** Apply the trained VAE to reconstruct existing 3D models and generate new synthetic tooth data, facilitating quantitative and qualitative analysis.
