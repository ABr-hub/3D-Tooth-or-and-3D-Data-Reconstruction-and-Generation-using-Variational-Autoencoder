# 3D Tooth (or any 3D Data) Reconstruction and Generation using Variational-Autoencoder (VAE)
This project utilizes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and generate synthetic 3D tooth models from point clouds. The model creates new tooth shapes for quantitative and visual analysis. It includes details on training, optimization, and performance evaluation using metrics like Chamfer Distance.
